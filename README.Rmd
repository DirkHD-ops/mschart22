The `mschart` package provides a framework for easily create charts for
'Microsoft PowerPoint' documents. It has to be used with package
[`officer`](https://davidgohel.github.io/officer/) that will produce the charts
in new or existing PowerPoint or Word documents.

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to create a line chart.

```{r example}
library(mschart)
library(officer)

linec <- ms_linechart(data = iris, x = "Sepal.Length",
                      y = "Sepal.Width", group = "Species")
linec <- chart_ax_y(linec, num_fmt = "0.00", rotation = -90)
```

Then use package `officer` to send the object as a chart.

```{r eval=FALSE}
doc <- read_pptx()
doc <- add_slide(doc, layout = "Title and Content", master = "Office Theme")
doc <- ph_with(doc, value = linec, location = ph_location_type(type = "body"))

print(doc, target = "example.pptx")
```

At any moment, you can type `print(your_chart, preview = TRUE)` to preview the
chart in a temporary PowerPoint file. This requires to have a PowerPoint Viewer
installed on the machine.

## Installation

You can get the development version from GitHub:

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("ardata-fr/mschart")
```

Or the latest version on CRAN:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("mschart")
```

### Bug reports

When you file a [bug report](https://github.com/ardata-fr/mschart/issues),
please spend some time making it easy for me to follow and reproduce. The more
time you spend on making the bug report coherent, the more time I can dedicate
to investigate the bug as opposed to the bug report.
